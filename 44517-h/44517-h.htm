With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come;
And let my liver rather heat with wine,

Why should a man, whose blood is warm through,
Sit like his grandsire, cut in alubaster?
Sleep when he wakes, and creep into the jaundice by being peevish?"

<h2>
PREFACE.
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t will be readily perceived that the literary part of this work is of
humble pretensions. One object alone has been aimed at and it is hoped
with success&mdash;to select or to invent those incidents which' might be
interesting or amusing in themselves, while they afforded scope for the
peculiar talents of the artist who adorns them with his designs. The
selection was more difficult than may at first sight be supposed. It is
true, there is no paucity of subjects of wit and humour, but he who will
take the trouble to examine them, will find how few are adapted for
pictorial representation. No artist can embody a point of wit, and the
humour of many of the most laughable stories would vanish at the touch of
the pencil of the most ingenious designer in the world. Those ludicrous
subjects only which are rich in the humour of <i>situation</i> are
calculated for graphic illustration. To prove the following anecdotes are
not deficient in this respect, no other appeal is necessary than to the
plates themselves! Look at the breadth of the humour, the point of the
situation, the selection of the figures, the action, and its
accompaniments, and deny (without a laugh on the face) that this portion
of the work answers the end in view. In all this the writer or compiler,
or whatever he may be called, claims little merit. That the whole effect
is comic, that the persons are ludicrous, and engaged in laughable groups
and surrounded with objects which tend to broaden the grin, all this, and
a thousand times more, belongs to Mr. Cruikshank;&mdash;the writer only
claims the merit of having suggested to him the materials.
</p>
<p>
Some of the ten points, now submitted to the public, arise out of a
reprint of that admirable piece of humour, the Jolly Beggars of Burns;&mdash;A
part of his works almost unknown to the public, in consequence of the
scrupulousness of the poet's biographer and editor, who withheld them from
the world. Lest we however should incur the charge, which Dr. Currie
apprehended, we beg leave to prefix the observations on this subject by
the first literary character in the kingdom, Sir Walter Scott, as they
appeared in the <i>Quarterly Review.</i>
</p>
<p>
"Yet applauding, as we do most highly applaud, the leading principles of
Dr. Currie's selection, we are aware that they sometimes led him into
fastidious and over-delicate rejection of the bard's most spirited and
happy effusions. A thin octavo, published at Glasgow in 1801, under the
title of 'Poems ascribed to Robert Burns, the Ayrshire bard,' furnishes
valuable proofs of this assertion; it contains, among a good deal of
rubbish, some of his most brilliant poetry. A cantata, in particular,
called <i>The Jolly Beggars</i>, for humorous description and nice
discrimination of character, is inferior to no poem of the same length in
the whole range of English poetry. The scene, indeed, is laid in the very
lowest department of low life, the actors being a set of strolling
vagrants, met to carouse, and barter their rags and plunder for liquor in
a hedge ale-house. Yet even in describing the movements of such a group,
the native taste of the poet has never suffered his pen to slide into any
thing coarse or disgusting. The extravagant glee and outrageous frolic of
the beggars are ridiculously contrasted with their maimed limbs, rags, and
crutches&mdash;the sordid and squalid circumstances of their appearance
are judiciously thrown into the shade. Nor is the art of the poet less
conspicuous in the individual figures, than in the general mass. The
festive vagrants are distinguished from each other by personal appearance
and character, as much as any fortuitous assembly in the higher orders of
life. The group, it must be observed, is of Scottish character, and
doubtless our northern brethren are more familiar with its varieties than
we are; yet the distinctions are too well marked to escape even the
southern. The most prominent persons are a maimed soldier and his female
companion, a hackneyed follower of the camp, a stroller, late the consort
of an highland ketterer, or sturdy beggar&mdash;'but weary fa' the waefu'
woodie!'&mdash;Being now at liberty, she becomes an object of rivalry
between a pigmy scraper with his fiddle' and a strolling tinker. The
latter, a desperate bandit, like most of his profession, terrifies the
musician out of the field, and is preferred by the damsel of course. A
wandering ballad-singer, with a brace of doxies, is last introduced upon
the stage. Each of these mendicants sings a song in character, and such a
collection of humorous lyrics, connected by vivid poetical description, is
not perhaps to be paralleled in the English language. The ditty chaunted
by the Ballad Singer is certainly far superior to any thing in the <i>Beggar's
Opera</i>, where alone we could expect to find its parallel.
</p>
<p>
"We are at a loss to conceive any good reason why Dr. Currie did not
introduce this singular and humorous cantata into his collection. It is
true, that in one or two passages the muse has trespassed slightly upon
decorum, where, in the language of Scottish song,
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"High kilted was she,
"As she gaed owre the lea."
</pre>
<p>
"Something, however, is to be allowed to the nature of the subject, and
something to the education of the poet: and if from veneration to the
names of Swift and Dryden, we tolerate the grossness of the one, and the
indelicacy of the other, the respect due to that of Burns, may surely
claim indulgence for a few light strokes of broad humour..
</p>
<p>
"Knowing that this, and hoping that other compositions of similar spirit
and tenor, might yet be recovered, we were induced to think that some of
them, at least, had found a place in the collection given to the public by
Mr. Cromek. But he has neither risqued the censure, nor gained the
applause, which might have belonged to such an undertaking."

<h2>
POINT I. THE POINT OF HONOUR.
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen the American army was at Valley Forge in the winter of 1777, a
captain of the Virginian Line refused a challenge sent him by a brother
officer, alleging that his life was devoted to the service of his country,
and that he did not think it a point of duty to risk it to gratify the
caprice of any man. This <i>point of duty</i> gave occasion to <i>a point
of humour</i> which clearly displayed the brilliant <i>points</i> of the
officer's character, and exposed the weak ones of his brothers in the
service in a very <i>pointed</i> manner. His antagonist gave him the
character of a coward through the whole army. Conscious of not having
merited the aspersion, and discovering the injury he should sustain in the
minds of those unacquainted with him, he repaired one evening to a general
meeting of the officers of that line. On his entrance, he was avoided by
the company, and the officer who had challenged him, insolently ordered
him to leave the room; a request which was loudly re-echoed from all
parts. He refused, and asserted that he came there to vindicate his fame;
and after mentioning the reasons which induced him not to accept the
challenge, he applied a large hand grenade to the candle, and when the
fuse had caught fire, threw it on the floor, saying, "Here, gentlemen,
this will quickly determine which of us all dare brave danger most."

<p>
At first they stared upon him for a moment in stupid astonishment, but
their eyes soon fell upon the fusé of the grenade, which was fast burning
down. Away scampered Colonel, General, Ensign, and Captain, and all made a
rush at the door. "Devil take the hindmost." Some fell, and others made
way over the bodies of their comrades; some succeeded in getting out, but
for an instant there was a general heap of flesh sprawling at the entrance
of the apartment. Here was a colonel jostling with a subaltern, and there
fat generals pressing lean lieutenants into the boards, and blustering
majors, and squeaking ensigns wrestling for exit; the size of one and the
feebleness of the other making their chance of departure pretty equal,
until time, which does all things at last, cleared the room and left the
noble captain standing over the grenade with his arms folded, and his
countenance expressing every kind of scorn and contempt for the train of
scrambling red coats, as they toiled and bustled and bored their way out
of the door.
</p>
<p>
After the explosion had taken place, some of them ventured to return, to
take a peep at the mangled remains of their comrade, whom however to their
great surprise they found alive and uninjured.&mdash;When they were all
gone, the captain threw himself flat on the floor as the only possible
means of escape, and fortunately came off with a whole skin, and a
repaired reputation.

<h2>
POINT II. THE SHORT COURTSHIP.
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>s a gentleman was passing along one of the more retired streets of London
late in the evening, he stumbled over the body of an old man, whom on
examination he found in a state of excessive inebriation, and who had in
consequence tumbled down and rolled into the kennel. He had not gone many
yards farther when he found an old woman very nearly in the same
circumstances. It immediately struck Mr. L. that this was some poor old
couple, who, overcome with the fatigues of the day, had indulged too
freely in some restorative beverage, whether Hodges' or Deady's the
historian does not say. Full of this idea, and animated by his own
charitable disposition, Mr. L. soon made arrangements for the reception of
the poor couple into a neighbouring public house, where the landlord
promised that the senseless pair should be undressed and placed in a warm
and comfortable bed. To bed they were put. Mr. L. left them lying side by
side, snoring in concert, and likely to pass together a more harmonious
night than perhaps would have been the case had they possessed the full
enjoyment of their senses. L. journeyed homewards filled with the
satisfaction arising from the performance of a kind deed, and never
reflected that there was a possibility of his having joined a pair whom
the laws of God had not made one. The fact was, that the old man and the
old woman were perfect strangers to each other, and their being found in a
similar situation was purely accidental. In London, however extraordinary
it may appear, many poor folks get drunk at night, especially Saturday
night, and what is not less wonderful, they are in this state often unable
to preserve their balance&mdash;the laws of gravity exert their influence,
and the patient rolls into the kennel. Soundly&mdash;soundly did this late
united pair sleep and snore till morning,&mdash;when the light broke in
upon them and disclosed the secret.&mdash;Imagine the consternation of the
old lady when the fumes of intoxication were dissipated, and she opened
her eyes upon her snoring partner&mdash;where she was or how she had been
put there she knew not. It was clear she was in bed with a man, and that
was an event which had never happened to her before,&mdash;so she set up a
scream, and roused the old gentleman, whose astonishment was not a jot
less than the lady's.

<p>
She sat upon end in bed staring at him, he moved himself into, a similar
situation and riveted his eyes upon her, and so they remained for a few
instant's both full of perfect wonderment;&mdash;at last it struck the
poor lady that this was some monster of a man who had succeeded in some
horrible design upon her honour; the idea in a moment gave her the look
and manner of a fury, she flung out of bed and roared aloud to the
admiration of all the inmates of the house, who attracted by her first
scream were already peeping in at the door of the room,&mdash;"make me an
honest woman, thou wretch," she cried&mdash;"villain that you are,&mdash;make
an honest woman of me, or I'll be the death of thee"&mdash;down she sat
upon the bed-stocks, and as she attempted to dress herself she interlarded
her occupation with calling for vengeance upon her horrible seducer, who
sat trembling at the other side of the bed, vainly attempting in his
fright to insinuate his legs into his old tattered breeches. The landlord
at last interfered with the authority of his station, and on inquiry found
that no breach had been made which could not be easily repaired. The old
gentleman was asked if he had any objection to take his fair bedfellow for
a helpmate during the remainder of his life; he stammered out his
acquiescence as well as he could, and the enraged virgin consented to
smooth down her anger on satisfaction being made to her injured honour.
The bargain was soon struck, the happy pair were bundled off to church,
amidst the laughing shouts of the mob, where a parson waited to make good
the match too precipitately formed by our charitable friend.

POINT III. YES OR NO?
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>rederick the Great, King of Prussia, was so remarkably fond of children,
that he suffered the sons of the Prince Royal to enter his apartment
whenever they thought proper. One day, while he was writing in his closet,
the eldest of these princes was playing at shuttlecock near him. The
shuttlecock happened to fall upon the table at which the King sat, who
threw it at the young prince and continued to write. The shuttlecock
falling on the table a second time, the King threw it back, looking
sternly at the child, who promised that no accident of the kind should
happen again; the shuttlecock however fell a third time and even upon the
paper on which the king was writing. Frederick then took the shuttlecock
and put it in his pocket: the little prince humbly asked pardon and begged
the King to return him his shuttlecock. His Majesty refused: the prince
redoubled his entreaties, but no attention was paid to them; the young
prince at length being tired of begging, advanced boldly towards the King,
put his two hands on his side, and tossing back his little head with great
haughtiness, said in a threatening tone, "Will your Majesty give me my
shuttlecock, Yes or No?"

<h2>
POINT IV. EXCHANGE NO ROBBERY.
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>ear Taunton, in Somersetshire, lived a sturdy fellow, by trade a miller,
who possessed a handsome and buxom young woman for his wife. The said dame
was many years the junior of her spouse, and thought that the neighbouring
village contained not a few more agreeable companions, than the one whom
Heaven had given her for life. Of this circumstance the miller had some
suspicions, and determined to set them at rest one way or the other.
Accordingly, one day he pretended to set off to buy corn, and told his
wife that he should not be at home that night. The miller departed, and
when the shades of evening afforded some concealment, in glided, to supply
his place at bed and board, a neighbouring country squire.
</p>
<p>
As the village clock struck one that night, and as the loving pair were
wrapped in sleep, a loud knocking was heard at the door.
</p>
<p>
The miller had unexpectedly returned home, and the unfortunate couple
within were reduced to despair. The wit of the female was however equal to
the emergency; the gentleman's clothes were pushed under her own, and his
person was conducted into the kitchen, by the frail fair one, and there
enclosed in a singular place of security.
</p>
<p>
The tall house clock, which always forms a part of the furniture of the
"parlour, kitchen, and all," of men of our miller's rank, was at that time
out of order, and the works had, on the very morning in question, been
conveyed to Taunton, to undergo a thorough repair. It immediately struck
the damsel that her lover could abide in no safer place than this, until
her husband was asleep, and she could return and let him out. Now the
country squire was a tall and a stout man, with a jolly rubicund
physiognomy. He consequently enclosed himself in the clock-case with some
difficulty, and when the good woman locked the door of it, as the only way
of keeping it shut, it gave him a nip in the paunch, which would have
extorted a cry under any other circumstances. As it was, the tightness
below threw all the blood into his countenance, which, for such was his
height, overtopped the wood work of the case, and appeared exactly at the
spot where the clock usually shewed the hour. So that, had a light been
held up to it, this portentous face would have borne the appearance of a
dark red moon scowling, out of fog and vapours upon a stormy night. This
despatched, the dame commenced her own part with confidence. She gaped and
yawned, and only admitted the miller till he had cursed and sworn his wife
into a conviction, that he was her lawful husband, and no deceiver who had
mimicked his voice and manner for his own wicked purposes. Much to the
dismay of the parties already in possession of the house, the miller
insisted upon striking a light, which at length obtaining, he drove his
wife before him up to the bed-room, and then slily and under pretence of
something else, examined the apartment; and concluded with a thorough
conviction of the groundlessness of his suspicions.
</p>
<p>
The wife, overjoyed at getting the candle out of the kitchen without
discovery, was in high good humour, so that the miller became in excellent
spirits too, both on account of his agreeable reception and the dispersion
of his fears, and as a proof of his state of mind gave his wife a hearty
kiss, and swore that they would go down and have a cozy bit of supper
together before they went to bed. In vain the poor woman resisted, the
slice of bacon must be broiled and the eggs poached. With trembling hand
she bore the light into the kitchen, and durst not cast a glance upon the
clock case where the prisoner, full of horror at the return of the candle,
and reduced to a state of insufferable impatience by his miserable plight,
uttered a deep low groan of despair as they entered the apartment.
Fortunately it was not loud enough to attract the miller's attention, but
thrilled through the heart of his unfortunate spouse. The happy pair soon
began their culinary operations, the male with a light heart and a hungry
appetite, the female sick and trembling at the disclosure which she feared
was inevitable. All she could do, she did. She tried to keep up a
conversation, she shaded the light, and she spread rasher after rasher
before the all-devouring miller, who seemed as if intent to display his
prowess before his rival, who was most ruefully and intently gazing upon
him from his window of observation.

<p>
By the lady's artful management, the miller sat with only a side view of
the clock, and allowed a few sympathizing glances to be interchanged
between the unhappy squire and his love, as she spread the tempting meal
before her liege lord. Doubtless they both thought the miller's appetite
was enormous, and in the calculation of either of them, he had already eat
a side of bacon, when he declared he had done. <i>Now for good luck!</i>
inwardly exclaimed the dame, <i>fortune befriend me, and let me get him up
stairs without casting a look upon that poor deplorable face</i>; which by
the bye had lately been assuming all hues, and within the last two minutes
had turned from a blue red to deadly pale, and back again to red black;
and slight twitches and convulsive motions were observed in the muscles of
his face, as if the poor unfortunate owner of them was tormented by some
body below, who alternately pricked and pinched him. Oh, what a weight was
taken off the heart of the frail fair one, and how fervently did she offer
up vows of chastity in the gratitude of the moment, when the miller,
having eat and drank his fill, made a motion for the bed room. Gladly was
she attending him, when, as ill luck would have it, a <i>loud sneeze</i>
was heard in the room, which was followed by an equally loud; scream from
the lady of the miller, who now gave all up for lost. It seemed that the
dust of the clock-case had been disturbed by the body of the squire, and
part of it being dislodged, had sought refuge in the intricacies of his
nostrils. Hence the wincings and writhings, which, over and above being
abominably nipped, produced the awful changes recorded above, and at
length ended in a sneeze, which he could no longer restrain. This event
had not the expected issue, for the dame in her fright threw down the
candlestick, which she held in her hand, and extinguished the light. The
good miller, now drowsy and stupid, chid her for being alarmed at the
sneezing of a <i>cat</i>; and, not waiting for the poking out of a light
from the dying embers, pushed his wife and himself off to bed, bestowing
upon her, by the way, many of those endearing caresses, which husbands in
a good humour lavish upon their wives; which caresses were certainly as
indifferent to her, as they were doubtless disagreeable to her friend in
the clock. Release was not so soon at hand as the parties sanguinely
expected, for though the miller slept, he took as secure a hold of his
faithful dame, as if he had really been aware of the gaol-delivery she
intended to accomplish. To her last resource, therefore, she was compelled
to fly, for the morning was fast coming on. The miller's sleep was broken
by the loud cries of his wife, who declared she was so ill, she was sure
she should die. She yelled and screamed till the poor man in despair knew
not what to do, and could only cry out <i>What can I get you, What can I
get you?</i> Now the wily dame well knew that <i>that</i> would be the
best for her complaint which was not in the house, so she vociferated <i>Brandy,
brandy, Oh for some brandy</i>. The poor husband scrambled up some
clothes, and set off for the nearest public house for some brandy, which
was nearly a mile from his abode. Arriving there, he knocked up the
landlord, who administered the medicine to him. To pay for which, the
distressed husband put his hand in his breeches' pocket, and much to his
own surprise, pulled out a large bundle of bank notes, at which he stared
in amazement; when the landlord cried out, Lord! <i>you have got Mr.
Farrer's breeches on</i>. Buckskins, it seems, well known in the
neighbourhood.
</p>
<p>
"<i>The Devil I have</i>," returned the miller, in a tone which came up
like a groan, as he gazed upon his nether man. Quickly comprehending the
secret of the exchange, he pocketed the notes, drank up the brandy for his
own consolation, and went home, moralizing his pensive path, and gave the
hypocritical culprit the soundest beating she ever had in her life. She,
poor soul! who had been charitably employed in the meanwhile, in letting
the bird out of his cage, was not prepared for this reception; nor did she
understand it until the next morning, when the breeches were cried round
the town by her malignant husband, who also with no pleasant expression of
countenance, made a point of turning over his newly-acquired riches in her
presence.

Sir Wisdom's a fool when he's fou,
Sir Knave is a fool in a session;
He's there but a prentice, I trow,
But I am a fool by profession.
My Grannie she bought me a beuk,
An' I held awa to the school;
I fear I my talent misteuk,
But what will ye hae of a fool.
For drink I would venture my neck;
A hizzie's the half of my craft;
But what could ye other expect
Of ane that's avowedly daft.
I ance was ty'd up like a stirk,
For civilly swearing and quaffing;
I ance was abus'd i' the Kirk,
For towzing a lass i' my daffin.
Poor Andrew that tumbles for sport,
Let naebody name wi' a jeer;
There's ev'n, I'm tauld, i' the court,
A <i>Tumbler</i> ca'd the <i>Premier</i>.
Observ'd ye yon reverend lad
Mak faces to tickle the mob;
He rails at our mountebank squad,
It's <i>rivalship</i> just i' the job.
And now my conclusion I'll tell,
For faith I'm confoundedly dry,
The chiel that's a fool for himsel,
Guid Lord, he's far dafter than I.

<h2>
POINT IX. THE DOWNFALL OF HOLY CHURCH.
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n the year of 1460, Revel was governed by a General, whose name was John
of Mengden; a worthy old man, who loved his glass of wine, and had the
gout; for wine and the gout are sister's children. It was his custom to
ride out occasionally on a black horse down to the shores of the Baltic,
whence he continued his way to a convent of nuns consecrated to St.
Bridget. This nunnery, which was called Marianthal, was situated about a
mile from the town, and its ruins are inhabited by owls and ravens.
</p>
<p>
On one of these excursions he was accompanied by the Lord Marshal, Gothard
of Plettenberg.
</p>
<p>
As they approached the convent wall, the Marshal's horse became suddenly
restive. "Have you heard," said he, "the strange, stories of the
subterraneous passage, and that it winds in intricate mazes round the
cloister?"&mdash;&mdash; "No," replied John of Mengden, "but I should like
to hear them over a bottle; you shall relate them to me in the evening."
</p>
<p>
"It may be done now, and in a few words," rejoined the other; "for we
stand exactly before the subterraneous passage, or mouth of the cavern;
but for fifty years, not a human foot has advanced beyond the bottom of
the steps, there the torches are always blown out."
</p>
<p>
The burgomaster of Revel, who was then with them, made a cross on his
breast, and confirmed the statement. "Sometimes," continued Gothard, "are
heard, during the night, the sounds of soft music, arising slowly and
melodiously from the cave, like the sweet tones of musical glasses, with
an accompaniment of the songs of angels. The holy sisters of the convent
are frequent listeners to this divine harmony, though none of the words
can be understood."
</p>
<p>
"Let the venerable Lady Abbess come down to me," said the general, as he
alighted from his horse, and placed his glove in his sword-belt. The
Abbess now appeared, veiled. She modestly curtsied to the knight, and
presented him with a cup of Spanish wine. The old General laid himself
down on the grass, and asked the sainted lady if she could give him any
information relative to the subterraneous passage? The Abbess replied in
the affirmative, adding a number of particulars concerning what she and
her pious sisters had seen,&mdash;and fancied they had seen&mdash;heard,
and fancied they had heard.
</p>
<p>
"So God and St. Vitus help me!" exclaimed the governor, "I will myself
make an attempt to descend into the cavern; give me a lighted, consecrated
torch."
</p>
<p>
The burgomaster crossed himself all over. A cold shivering seized him; the
only vault into which he had been accustomed to descend, was the
town-cellar which was haunted by none but <i>choice spirits</i>, with
which he was familiar.
</p>
<p>
The lady Abbess entreated the old man not to undertake so rash an
enterprize; and assured him, that the spirits of former times, unlike
those of the present day, would not allow themselves to be sported with.
But in arguing with the brave old General, they talked to the wind which
blew over the Baltic. The consecrated torches were brought, the corpulent
General repeated an Ave-Maria, recommended himself to St. Vitus, his
protecting Saint, and courageously entered the mysterious passage. The
sound of his feet was still heard on the steps; his breathing was still
audible, and the glimmer of his torch played on the damp walls. On a
sudden all was silent, and the light disappeared. The listeners above were
on the stretch of attention. Go-thard was stationed on the upper step; the
burgomaster a few paces further back; and behind him stood the Abbess, her
rosary running through her fingers. They listened, but all was still!
"Holloa there, John of Mengden!&mdash;how fare you?" thundered the voice
of Gothard; yet all was still as the grave. The listeners were alarmed;
they inclined their ears; they stood lightly on tip-toe; they restrained
their breath&mdash;not a sound ascended. The cavern yawned before them,
and all was silent below; "Holy St. Bridget! what can have happened? Let
the priests be summoned, and mass be said, to appease the spirits!"
</p>
<p>
The lady Abbess hastened to the convent, rang the chapel-bell, when all
the pious sisterhood hurried from their cells, fell upon their bare knees,
chastizing themselves, and praying to heaven for mercy towards the old
General. The burgomaster threw himself upon his horse, and trotted back to
the town to impart the terrible news to his wife, children and domestics.
Gothard, who was a courageous knight, alone remained, absorbed in gloomy
reflection, leaning against the wall, with his eyes fixed on the darkness
beneath. Thus he continued during two hours. At last he thought he heard
on the steps, some one breathing and struggling.&mdash;"John of Mengden!"
he vociferated&mdash;"are you alive, or dead?"&mdash;-"I am alive!"
replied the General, half breathless, as he stumbled up the steps. "Thanks
to God and St. Bridget!&mdash;we have been in agony on your account. Where
have you been? What have you heard or seen?" The General then related that
he had quietly descended, with the consecrated taper in his hand; that his
heart beat a little as he advanced; that a cold shiver had begun to seize
him; but that he took courage, as his taper burnt always clear and bright:
that at length he stood on the bottom step, and looked down an endless
passage, doubtful whether, under the protection of St. Bridget, he should
move forward or backward; that suddenly he was surrounded by a lukewarm
breeze, mild and fragrant, as if wafted over a bed of flowers, which in a
moment extinguished his taper, and so clouded his senses, that he sunk
like a dead man on the steps, and then lay a considerable time in a sort
of trance; that at last he awoke again, and it appeared to him as if he
were gently moved by a warm hand, though he knew not where he was, nor
what had happened to him; that he stretched out his hands, and felt
nothing but the cold stone; but that, as a little daylight glimmered upon
him from above, he composed his spirits, and began to creep with
difficulty up the steps; that when on them he was perfectly recovered,
feeling only a slight oppression in the head, similar to the effect of
intoxication.
</p>
<p>
"Well, brother," said he to the lord-marshal, "will not you also make the
attempt, and try whether it will not succeed better with you."
</p>
<p>
Gothard of Plettenberg demurred: notwithstanding he never feared, in
former times, a knight of flesh and bone, as long as he was able to wield
his sword; yet, with respect to ghosts, a very just exception was allowed;
and a knight might tremble in the dark like an old woman, without any
stain upon his honor, or impeachment of his valour. Now a days, the matter
is quite altered, and a man may fear any thing but ghosts.
</p>
<p>
"By my sword," said the governor, as he was returning home, "I will
investigate the causes of this mystery. I must know from whose mouth
proceeded the gentle breath, that smelt fragrant as the plants of the
east, and yet had force enough to extinguish the flame of the consecrated
taper, and even to confuse my head, as though I had been drunk."
</p>
<p>
He instantly sent for Henry of Uxkull, bishop of Revel, and the Abbot, of
Pardis. Being arrived, they were entertained at a large oak table, and
quaffed wine from the family goblet. They listened to the fearful story of
their host, with their fat hands folded upon their huge bellies, and shook
their heads with significant silence.
</p>
<p>
Having well weighed the matter, knitted their brows and assumed an air of
importance, they finally agreed <i>that they knew not what to think of it</i>.
Each then waddled to his home and thought no more of the mysterious
cavern.
</p>
<p>
But it was not so with the General. He could not rest. His fancy was on
the rack, to account for the mystery. On the next morning, he despatched
letters to the Archbishop of Riga, to a learned canon, and two pious deans
of the holy church of Riga&mdash;stating "that a surprising incident had
obliged him to have recourse to their piety and wisdom, and entreating
that they would be at Revel on St. Egidius's day, to discuss in Christian
humility this weighty affair."
</p>
<p>
They came on the appointed day: for they were aware that the cellar of the
Governor contained excellent wine, and that his was no niggard
hospitality. The archbishop of Revel, and the Abbot of Pardis, were
likewise invited to assist, who failed not at the proper hour to present
themselves at the castle. An elegant repast had been prepared for them,
bumpers went cheerily round to the prosperity of Holy Church, and to the
perpetual bloom of the German order of religion. When their spiritual
stomachs were sufficiently gorged, the General thus addressed them:
"Reverend and pious fathers! thus and thus it happened to me and my friend
here, Gothard of Plettenberg," recounting his story&mdash;"What is to be
done to liberate the spirits who wander and breathe in the subterraneous
passage?"
</p>
<p>
"They must be driven out by force," replied the archbishop of Riga, "and
the power to do this was given to bishops from above."
</p>
<p>
"A wisp of hay should be steeped in holy water," added the canon, "with
which the steps of the dark passage should be sprinkled."
</p>
<p>
One of the deans advised that "the little chest with the Egyptian
hieroglyphics, which was kept as a relic in the convent of St. Bridget,
should be taken to the cavern.".
</p>
<p>
The other dean was of opinion that the spirits should be allowed to
continue without molestation so long as they only wandered and breathed.
</p>
<p>
The archbishop of Revel was also of the same sentiment, but the Abbot of
Pardis applauded this idea of the Egyptian hieroglyphics.
</p>
<p>
Last of all, the old General proposed that they should immediately ride to
the beach, and employ the arms of the church against the inhabitants of
the subterraneous passage. The wine had imparted its spirit to the holy
fathers; and they now felt courage to engage, if necessary, even with the
fiends of hell.
</p>
<p>
Within half an hour they were at the convent gate!
</p>
<p>
Three times were the consecrated torches borne round by the archbishop,
who, muttering between his teeth, dipped the wisp into a large ewer of
holy water, and plentifully besprinkled all present; Thus spiritually
armed, they silently and cautiously approached the entrance of the cavern.
Here a question arose, "who should go down first?" Those who were at home
were unwilling to rob the strangers of the honor of precedence. The deans
drew back, as being merely subalterns in the church, out of respect to
their bishop. The archbishop bowed to the right learned canon, and he
bowed to the rest. The General became impatient, and forced the archbishop
down the steps. The rest followed with beating hearts and tottering knees.
</p>
<p>
Each carried in his hand a consecrated taper; and with a rosary hanging at
his elbow, sprinkled the walls with drops of holy water. The last of the
procession was the Abbot of Pardis, who, grown unwieldy by the luxurious
diet of the church, could scarcely drag his short puffed legs after his
fat and bulky paunch. The steps too were not only small, but damp and
slippery; whence it happened, that on the second step the Abbot lost his
footing, and falling with his whole weight upon Henry of Uxkull, they both
fell upon the last dean: all three on the first dean; all four on the
canon; all five upon the archbishop of Riga; when the whole troop rolled
helter skelter down the steps, and plumped to the bottom like so many
sacks, there remaining senseless!

<p>
The consecrated tapers were extinguished, and the venerable group were
veiled by a sort of Egyptian darkness. The General, who remained above,
heard the tremendous rumbling, to which succeeded a dead silence. For two
hours he listened, called on each by name, and waited in vain for a reply.
His voice alone was returned to him in a dull and hollow echo. The only
sound which met his eager listening, was that of the terrified bat,
flitting in the depths of the cavern; or, at intervals, the scream of the
frightened owl.
</p>
<p>
He was a man of uncommon courage, and he resolved to descend once more
himself, to see what was become of his guests; but as a prelude to this
perilous expedition, he determined to enliven his natural spirits by a
draught of generous wine. As he vociferated&mdash;"a cup of wine," to the
groom who held his horse, the word Wine reached the ears of the holy men&mdash;they
disentangled themselves from each other, scrambled up, their foreheads
bedewed with the sweat of terror, and when they had recovered themselves,
they confessed unanimously <i>that they were not able to unravel the
mystery.</i>
</p>
<p>
Thus ended the second attempt to gain a more intimate acquaintance with
the spirits of the subterraneous passage, and thenceforward no one was
bold enough to tread the magic ground.

<h2>
POINT X. A VISIT WITHOUT FORM.
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen the Cardinal Bernis resided at Rome in the capacity of Ambassador
from France, he bore the highest character for sanctity&mdash;yet the
Cardinal was a man, though a churchman; and churchmen are sometimes not
invulnerable to the shafts of love. A pair of speaking black eyes like
those of the Princess B., have before now made sad havoc in the heart of
the votary of celibacy. The lady was conscious of her own charms, but
being married to the man she loved, instead of setting them off by certain
little manouvres which some ladies perfectly understand how to put in
practice, she carefully avoided giving any encouragement to the Cardinal,
whose constant attendance upon her began to give her some uneasiness. At
length the Cardinal, finding that his visits, attentions, <i>cadeaux</i>,
and fine speeches had no effect, determined upon seeking an opportunity of
making the lady sensible of the excess of his passion. One morning the
Princess, on returning from mass, in her haste to avoid a violent shower
of rain, tripped as she was getting out of her carriage, and sprained her
ancle. The Cardinal, who by his spies was informed of every step the
Princess took, had attended at mass also; and as he was following the
Princess, unobserved, he saw the accident and ran to her assistance,
raised her into the carriage, and very humbly entreated her to allow him
the honour of seeing her safe home. His Excellency was not to be refused
consistently with etiquette, so the poor Princess was under the necessity
of hearing all the pretty things the Ambassador had reserved for the
occasion. All his protestations and entreaties proved fruitless, and the
poor lady arrived at the palace almost exhausted with the alarm the
conversation had caused her. She now endeavoured with all care to avoid
receiving the Cardinal's visits, but the old gentleman's amorous plans
were not to be thwarted.&mdash;He still found means of seeing her, and
again attacked her with his vows and protestations, so that the lady,
unable to bear it any longer, determined to inform the Prince, and related
to him all the circumstances of the affair. The Prince was enraged, and
threatened all kinds of vengeance against the lover; but however, when the
first burst of passion had a little subsided, he said to her, "We are, my
love, in a very aukward situation, for the Cardinal being Ambassador his
person is sacred; besides we should have the whole consistory and his
holiness at their head, thundering excommunication upon us. However, I
will think of some scheme of cooling the passion of this holy gentleman."
He accordingly suggested that she should write word to the Cardinal, that
as her husband was going that evening to his Villa near Tivoli, to order
some improvement to be made which would detain him the best part of next
day, she had determined to admit a visit from him; but that in order to
keep the matter a secret from the servants, she desired him to come at
midnight; that she would fix a silken ladder at her room window which
looked into the garden, whence he might easily ascend into the anti-room,
where he would find the door open that led into her own room. The reader
will naturally conceive the transports which this delicious billet excited
in the worthy Cardinal. He danced, and leaped and capered about for joy,
rang the bell, gave contradictory orders, and convinced his valet that he
was mad. He had the sense however to direct a suit of his finest linen to
be prepared, and to countermand the order for his carriage, for he
bethought himself he had better go privately. How tedious did the hours,
which intervened before the time of appointment, appear to our ardent
lover, and when the clock struck eleven he could no longer wait. It was a
good distance, he must be there in time, not a second too late; therefore
off he set after taking some precautions against his sacred person being
discovered. He arrives, panting with love and hope; the burning of
Mongibello could scarcely exceed the conflagration within him. He gets to
the garden-gate. One cannot think of every thing. The Princess in her
flurry had forgotten to order the garden-gate to be left open. What was to
be done? The wall was not high; but must his Eminence endanger his sacred
person? Love, however, the sovereign ruler, who makes even cowards heroes,
animated him. It was dreadfully dark; but luckily, in feeling for the
height of the wall, the anxious lover found an aperture in it large enough
to admit the foot: into this he stepped, gave a spring, and got to the
top; and then slid down the other side, not however without losing his hat
and cloak, which owing to the darkness of the night he could not find
again, nor was he aware, for the same reason, how he was daubed with
mortar and brick-dust. In this pickle, our Adonis made the best of his way
to find the ladder, tumbling over orange-trees and rosebushes, to the
manifest injury of his cassock, which began to hang about him in rags. At
last he reached the ladder, seized hold of it, stopped, panted a while for
breath, and then up he went. He had just got one leg through the window,
when the two large folding doors of the apartment flew open, and fifteen
or twenty servants with lighted torches in their hands presented
themselves before him.

<p>
The Prince, at their head, ran up to the window, and with all courtesy
helped in the astonished Cardinal, and turning to the servants said,
"Scoundrels! is it thus you pay respect to the sacred person of the
Cardinal Bernis? Is it thus, by your negligence, that you compel his
Eminence, when coming to my wife, to venture his precious life upon a
slight ladder and force him through the window in this miserable plight?"
Conceive the situation of the bald-pated, cloakless, and tattered
Cardinal, as he stood ashamed and terrified before the jeering Prince and
his twenty torchbearers. His trembling knees could scarcely support him,
as, half dead with fright, shame, and disappointment, he sneaked out of
the room, still lighted by the torches and bowed out by the Prince, who
continued to apologize for the carelessness of his servants, much to the
annoyance of the poor Cardinal, whose misery was heightened by one stroke
more; for, as he was huddling off, he just caught the face of the
Princess, peeping through the opening of a door with some friends, all
almost convulsed with laughter.
